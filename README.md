Watch videos directly on YouTube with your friends üçø.
You no longer need [sync-video](https://sync-video.com), [watch2gether](https://www.watch2gether.com) for watching videos on YouTube. Simply create a room on YouTube and send the link to your friends.

## Why should I use this and not sync-video / watch2gether / ... ?

Using this plugin you can watch videos directly on YouTube with your friends and don't need to visit an extra site.
You also have the advantage that you can synchronise livestreams and Videos which have been blocked for embedded play. You also can use the features YouTube has to offer e.g. liking the current video, storing the current video in your private playlist and many more ü§©.

## Features

- Synchronising Videos and livestreams directly on YouTube
- Basic permission system
- Queue functionality
- Autoplay functionality
- Reactions
- Dark and light mode (depending on your YouTube setting)

If you think there is anything missing then just create a [feature request](#feature-request).

## Installation

### Tampermonkey

To install the plugin you first need to download and install Tampermonkey for your Browser:

- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
- [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/)

After you installed Tampermonkey just head to the [release section](https://github.com/Tandashi/YTSync-Plugin/releases) and click on the `lib.user.js` Asset on the latest release. A popup should appear. Just click on install and you're done üéâ.

### Native Plugin

There is also a native version available for those who do not want to install Tampermonkey.

- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/ytsync/)
- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ytsync/djjmipmoebdhkblgmllkehfghaekbimi)

### Build from source

Required build dependencies:

- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (tested with v14+ but will probably work with v12 or less as well)

After you installed all the needed dependencies you can get the source code by cloning the git repository:

```bash
# SSH
git clone git@github.com:Tandashi/YTSync-Plugin.git

# HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/Tandashi/YTSync-Plugin.git
```

To install the dependencies run the following command:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Using yarn
yarn install
```

To build the plugin you can run the following command:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run build -- --env=prod 		# Production build (Minified version)
npm run build -- --env=dev 		  # Development build (Includes Source map, ...)
npm run build -- --env=browser 	# Build the Browser Plugin

# Using yarn
yarn build --env=prod 		      # Production build (Minified version)
yarn build --env=dev 		        # Development build (Includes Source map, ...)
yarn build --env=browser 	      # Build the Browser Plugin
```

After you build the plugin you can find it in `build/`.

## Usage

### Creating a room

To create a room simply visit a video and click on the `Create Sync` button. After you joined the sync session simply copy the URL and share it with your friends.

### Adding a video to the queue

Simply navigate to the video you want to add and click the `Add to Queue` button. It should automatically be added to the queue if you have the [permissions](#permissions-roles) to do so.

### Removing a video from the queue

Simply use the [trash icon](#queue) next to the video. If you have the [permissions](#permissions-roles) to do so it should be gone after you clicked. There is only one case where this will not work no matter your [permissions](#permissions-roles). There has to be one video in the queue at any time. So you will not be able to remove the last video.

### Playing the next video / a video from the queue

To play the next video or any video that is currently in the queue simply click on it. If you have the permissions to do so the clicked video should begin to start for everyone. There is also an autoplay functionality that, when enabled, will play the next video in the queue, if there is any, after the current video has ended.

## Queue

![](doc/queue.png)

The queue information is displayed on the right side at the top.

## Room Information

### Colors and what they mean
